Hello and welcome to my humble blog!

I went ahead and made this blog after reading that it's helpful to have a place to detail your journey through the learning experience and to explain your projects. While I'm usually not the type of person to put my thought processes in words, I figured it would be a good idea to get into the habit of blogging to help reinforce my education. Also, I'm a terrible writer so improving my own basic writing abilities is a plus. My goal with this blog is to record my journey through self-taught programming. I'll touch on what knowledge I gain from courses and my experience applying that new understanding in projects, along with the difficulties I'll no doubt encounter.

My name is Shawn Korns and I'm a 25 year old aspiring software and web developer. I have an associate's degree in Computer Science and Liberal Arts that I acquired through my education at Austin Community College in Texas. I've spent most of this year grinding away at front-end web development courses and projects through the curriculums of several different websites. These sites are [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com), [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

Considering I started learning with freeCodeCamp, which uses no voice or video for its lessons, I was interested to see how Treehouse would work for me. I've had little to no issues with the site so far, and there are plenty of talented teachers that explain things in clear, easy to follow layman's terms. This place is great.

The Odin Project

I've just recently found this site and so far it seems solid. Instead of teaching you through the site itself, lessons usually link to handpicked outside sources for learning. These can be anything from youtube videos, codecademy lessons and technical documents.

FreeCodeCamp offers a massive curriculum of programming education that feels daunting at first, but most lessons can be completed in a minute or two. What's amazing about this site is that all of the lessons, projects and certifications are free! I'm spoiled after using Treehouse however, as the lessons on freeCodeCamp are all text-based with no video tutorials. The strength of this site comes from the projects that let you apply your learning.
